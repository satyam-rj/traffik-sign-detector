# traffik-sign-detector

Traffic Sign Detection using CNN and Keras

Description

A deep learning-based traffic sign detection model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Keras and TensorFlow. The model classifies images of traffic signs into 43 categories.

Features

Uses CNN architecture for high accuracy.

Data augmentation applied to improve model generalization.

Trained on GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset.

Requirements
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pillow

How to Run
python traffic_sign_detection.py
